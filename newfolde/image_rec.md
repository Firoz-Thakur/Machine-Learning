Image recognition, in the context of machine vision, is the ability of software to identify objects, places, people, writing and actions in images. Computers can use machine 
vision technologies in combination with a camera and artificial intelligence software to achieve image recognition.

Image recognition is used to perform a large number of machine-based visual tasks, such as labeling the content of images with meta-tags, performing image content search and 
guiding autonomous robots, self-driving cars and accident avoidance systems.
